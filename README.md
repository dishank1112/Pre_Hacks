Project Title: Social Media Analyzer
Description
This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to build a robust semantic data retrieval system. It processes raw text, generates embeddings using NVIDIA models, and stores them in AstraDB VectorStore for efficient search and retrieval. Designed for scalability and accuracy, the system enables semantic document searches that go beyond keyword-based matching.

Workflow
Data Ingestion: Text data is input and processed via the Split Text component, breaking it into manageable chunks with overlapping tokens for context preservation.
Embedding Generation: NVIDIA's embedding model transforms text chunks into high-dimensional vectors capturing semantic meaning.
Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in AstraDB VectorStore, a high-performance vector database ensuring efficient retrieval.
Query Handling: The AstraDB Retriever executes similarity-based queries to fetch relevant documents, ensuring precise results.
Output Display: Processed results are displayed seamlessly in the output interface.
Tools Used
Langflow: For building the modular workflow.
NVIDIA Embedding Provider: For generating text embeddings.
AstraDB VectorStore: For scalable vector storage and retrieval.
Python Utilities: For preprocessing and splitting text.
Future Scope
Integration with additional machine learning models for enhanced embeddings.
Support for multimedia data, including images and audio.
Deployment as a microservice for enterprise use cases.
